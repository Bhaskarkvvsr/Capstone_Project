# Investigating Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

## Project Motivation

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to find fraudsters and take appropriate actions.

## File Description

- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebooks

There will be a notebook for each one of the Machine Learning Pipeline steps:

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building

## Results of the analysis

Results and discussion were published on Medium: [Fraud Detection](https://medium.com/@bhaskar.kamireddy09/how-to-detect-fraud-transactions-e0ff058b2116)

Fraud detection in banking is a critical activity that can span a series of fraud schemes and fraudulent activity from customers. In this blog, I have discussed a machine learning approach to detect Fraudulent customers.:
- Checked missing values in the dataset and analyzed various types of feature categories(Numerical vs Categorical)
- Handled rare categorical values and handled them.
- Selected important features from the dataset and used them while model building.
- Apply supervised Learning Algorithms, namely Logistic regression and Random forest to predict the fradulent transactions
- Evaluated the performance of the model using various techniques like precison-recall curve etc.
- Suggested few improvements to increase the performance of the model.
